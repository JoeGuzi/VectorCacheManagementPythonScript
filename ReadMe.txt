This script Creates the vector tile package and utilizes the Over Write Vector Tile Package 
script available http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e94507f5477b4a2c9ecbd1b198e0fad2 
Many thanks to Kelly Gerrow for the Over Write Vector Tile Package Script. 

This script allows you to update a Vector Tile Package and overwrite the Vector Tile Service
in one easy script. Replace the Variables with the appropriate variables for your Vector Cache
and everything should work just fine. 

If you need to rebuild multiple Vector Caches copy and 
paste the entire vairable block and change the variables and their values for the second 
Cache. Then copy and paste the Process: Creating the Cache 1 Vector Tile Package and Over 
writing ArcGIS Online lines and replace the variables with the new variables you created in
the step before.
